## Building on Literate Technology (LT)

### The Literacy Stack
Examine how different types of literacy manifest in LT systems:
- Reading comprehension vs. pattern matching
- Writing fluency vs. true composition
- Translation as a special case of literacy
- Where each layer excels and struggles

### Teaching Literate Technology
Practical examples from classes at the Center for Homeland Defense & Security:
- What clicked for students when framing as LT vs AI/LLM
- Questions and discussions the LT framing unlocked
- Real examples of homework or projects that worked well
- Security professionals' unique perspectives on LT

### When Literacy Isn't Enough
Exploring the boundaries of the LT metaphor:
- Where being "literate" falls short of understanding
- The gap between reading/writing and wisdom
- What breaks when we push the literacy model too far
- What this reveals about both machine and human literacy

### Curating with Literate Technology
How LT transforms curation (connecting to Curation Engine work):
- The changing role of human curators
- LT as a curation amplifier vs. replacement
- Building exhibits that write themselves
- Vector search as a form of conceptual curation

## Homeland Security & LT Applications

### LT for Crisis Communication
How literate technology helps during emergencies:
- Synthesizing multiple information streams
- Translating technical reports for decision makers
- Real-time narrative generation from data

### The 250,000 Document Problem
Deep dive into integrating LLMs with the Homeland Security Digital Library:
- Challenges of scale and specificity
- Making decades of reports suddenly accessible
- What changes when every document can "talk"

## Technical Deep Dives

### Vector Search for Humans
Demystifying embeddings and vector search:
- What vectors actually represent
- Why similarity search feels like magic
- Practical examples from Curation Engine

### Ruby on Rails + LT: 18 Years Later
How LT fits into established web frameworks:
- Patterns that work (and don't) 
- Keeping Rails apps simple while adding LT
- Real examples from production apps

## Philosophical/Cultural

### Procedural Exhibitions and Meaning
How Curation Engine creates meaning from chaos:
- Can generated narratives have authentic voice?
- The difference between coherent and meaningful
- What we learn from 100% procedural exhibitions

### Fun as a Feature
Expanding on your principle that "fun is a feature, not a bug":
- Why enterprise software is often joyless
- Examples of adding delight without sacrificing utility
- How LT can make tools more playful

## Vision Pro & Spatial Computing

### Building for Eyes and Hands
Lessons from developing for Vision Pro:
- What changes when compute is spatial
- Natural interfaces for LT in VR/AR
- Why procedural generation matters more in 3D

### The Museum in Your Living Room
Curation Engine's vision for spatial exhibitions:
- Moving beyond flat screens and websites
- Exhibitions that respond to your space
- The future of cultural experiences
